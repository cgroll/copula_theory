Modified copulas
================

There exist several approaches to transform a given copula into a new
copula. The idea is that these transformations simply keep the uniform
margins. For example, if $$(U_{1},U_{2})\sim C$$, then
$$(1-U_{1},U_{2})$$ still follows a copula distribution. The most
prominent such modifications are rotations and reflections.
