title: Conditioning trees

### Definition: Conditioning tree

Let $$(X_{1},\ldots,X_{d})$$ be a random vector with distribution
given by a pair copula construction. For each $$X_{i}\in
(X_{1},\ldots,X_{d})$$ the conditioning tree $$\mathfrak{T}(X_{i}, PCC)$$
represents all analytically accessible conditional distributions of
$$X_{i}$$ in vine $$PCC$$.

### Visualization

graphviz, d3

### Data representations

- CondTreePaths: -> close to conditioning sets
- CondTreeParNot: -> concise -> easy for graphViz
- CondTreeHier: -> close to JSON -> good for d3
- CondTreeIncid: -> close to graphs
- CondTreeAdja: -> close to graphs
